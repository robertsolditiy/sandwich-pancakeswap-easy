In a nutshell, a sandwich attack involves "sandwiching" a user's transactions in between two transactions.
These two transactions are before and after the users transaction (hence the name sandwich), 
generating a loss for the user and a gain for the you. Sandwich attacks typically take place on decentralized exchanges 
(DEXs) and result in price manipulation.
